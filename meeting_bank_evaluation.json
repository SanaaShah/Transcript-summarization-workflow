    "summary": "Councilwoman Zendaya's Councilmember Miranda Recommendation to request city manager to report back on enforcement for violations of the city's health order. This item came up from a letter that came from the commission, from our health commissioners. Many people have been asking us about what we're doing on enforcement for mask. We've had to close down our economy because we've had COVID cases on the rise. It's very difficult to see some of our small businesses closed whenever we see in some places that people aren't following the rules and that it's those rules that are being broken that are leading to some of our high cases. So I've asked the city manager just to share briefly what the process currently is for enforcing our mask. And then I'm asking the city manager to come back to the council with some examples of what other cities have done. Tom, could you please share just briefly what the enforcement is for the public? So we do have a requirement in our health order to mask and wear face coverings. We've been having a pretty strict run in since the very beginning of the pandemic, and we are now currently aligned with what the state law is, which is essentially that it needs to be worn almost at all times. It's subject to a couple of exclusions and it is a violation of the health order with a misdemeanor. Generally, when our team sees people, whether that be our health team, our code enforcement or even police officers are called, we tend to see pretty good compliance where when we ask them, they put on a mask or they are . And at times we also hand out mass. We have youth ambassadors who go into hotspots and they can actually hand people masks. District eight. I. Motion carries. Great. Next item will be we're going we have we have two hearings which we haven't gotten to yet. So let's go out and do the tearing, which is item 28 and 29. You're. Item 28 Report from Economic Development Recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record. Conclude the public hearing. Adopt a resolution. Actually, actually, you know what, Madam Court, let me do I have a request from Councilmember Pearce, and it is it is her last meeting. So we're going to we're going to take items 31 and 34.",
    "reference_summary": "The council meeting discussed the enforcement of the city's health order, particularly the wearing of masks to curb the spread of COVID-19. Councilmember Pearce requested the city manager to report on the current enforcement process and to research how other cities are handling enforcement. The city manager explained that the health order requires masks to be worn almost at all times, with a few exceptions. Violations are treated as misdemeanors. Enforcement is primarily through reminders and handing out masks, but there are challenges when individuals refuse to comply. The council discussed the possibility of civilian enforcement and the need for clear communication about the rules. The city manager also emphasized that city employees are expected to adhere to the health order. The council agreed to further research and discussion on the matter."

President, I just also want to herbal or highlight what Councilmember Herbold had said about ensuring that this program works for folks that have different ages and abilities, who might be experiencing disabilities, that we ensure that the program is set up so that we're not creating clutter on our sidewalks. And we need to ensure safety, equity and proper use are retained and that we provide people a new way to move through our city that ensures that we are transitioning away from gas powered cars and that we are able to get people the last mile between the transportation systems that we have in their homes or destinations where they're going. Now, as indicated before and as I voted in committee, I intend to vote in favor of both of these bills. I do think it's time for us to advance the pilot program and and and begin to have conversations about the future of this mobility device in our city at a at a greater scale.

    "reference_summary": "The meeting discussed the amendment and restatement of the service plan for the Denver International Business Center Metropolitan District. The purpose of the amendment is to make the service plan more consistent with those recently approved by the city, including adjusting the debt limitation to allow for continued development. The district supports a commercial-only development as residential construction is prohibited due to a zoning overlay currently imposed on the property by Denver International Airport. The district was organized in 1994 and the service plan was subsequently amended by the city in 2000. The district will finance and construct public improvements and operate and maintain the public improvements that are not accepted for ownership or maintenance by the city or any other entity. The district's public improvements will be for the use and benefit of the anticipated taxpayers of the district. The current and proposed commercial-only development will have a positive economic impact on the area, including employment and business cultivation. The district currently has approximately 205,000 square feet of commercial space, 31,000 square feet of retail space, and 980 hotel rooms with a combined appraised value of $90 million. It is estimated the continued development in the district will add 2.5 million square feet of commercial space, 130,000 square feet of retail space, 1700 hotel rooms and 900,000 square feet of light office space for an estimated future appraised value of $670 million. The total estimated costs of the future public improvements necessary to serve the continuing contemplated development is approximately $110,200,000. The district will have the power to raise revenues pursuant to the authorities granted by the Special District Act, including the imposition of up to 60 mills plus rates, fees, tolls and charges for debt and district operations and maintenance. The city staff recommends approval of the amended and restated service plan."

    "summary": "Communication from Vice Mayor Richardson, Councilwoman Gonzalez, Councilmember Pierce, Councilwoman Price recommendation to request the city manager to work with the Department of Parks, Recreation and Marine and the Commission on Youth and Children to update their purpose and structure to better serve the youth of Long Beach and report back within 90 days. So the Commission on Youth and Children was established in 2003 and is currently overseen by the Department of Parks, Recreation and Marine. At that time, the purpose was to advise and make policy recommendations to the City Council of the Needs, Concerns and Problems of Children and Youth promote coordination with Long Beach Unified School District and other youth based organizations, and to review various city plans that are now outdated. The Commission is a youth adult board consisting of ten adults and nine youth. You know, we've we have very highly, highly qualified and capable committee members, but according to staff, has been challenging to fill all the positions, particularly youth seats. And it's been increasingly difficult to reach a quorum because of that. Currently, 13 of the 19 maximum positions are filled. Additionally, I've spoken with a number of the adult commissioners who feel there's a lack of clarity from the Commission's point of view on the purpose and scope of work as it relates to current city priority priorities. So in working with the mayor's office and working with staff and commissioners, it seems like a good point in time now to pause, assess the current status of the Commission and evaluate how how to ensure that the Commission has an updated purpose, a more defined scope, a scope of work based on the city's current programs, our current initiatives. And so while I know that many of our separate Council districts have youth commit youth advisory boards or youth committees, we're also exploring, you know, what might look like if we were to explore the feasibility and advantages of of a separate citywide youth youth led commission and an adult commission. So we want the so essentially this motion is asking our commission to look at these things outlined in the recommendation in the background and make some recommend some actionable recommendations that the city council can, can, can do to make sure we update this commission and take on some of our fantastic work to support our youth. And I think that, you know, about a year and a half ago, I brought an item to council that asked the Commission on Youth to come back with an analysis and a report for us on after school activities. And I still haven't received that report, and it's been a year and a half. So I think there's a lot of opportunities for us to really emphasize and focus on the structure and help them give them the support that they need. And so I think that and I think it's important to note that this item is not a reflection of what we want is to empower this commission and we want the commission to work with staff to inform us what is it that we need to do to support the Commission more? It's a it's an amazing commission to sit on. So I think this is a great opportunity to refocus, look at the priorities of the city, the priorities of this council around the issues of youth and children, and really create a collaborative board that and commission that can work with you could answer your questions. We have a motion and a second. Members, please go ahead and cast your votes. And again, thank you to our speakers and to our two commissioners that spoke today.",

    "summary": "Recommendation to request the city attorney to draft a resolution in support of comprehensive immigration reform. Today's resolution on immigration reform should be tabled a, b, b before you is a letter from the organization called Flush the TPP dot org. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is I'm sorry, stopping the Trans-Pacific Partnership is immigration rights. This week or next week, Congress will be voting on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. City Council is urging Congress to vote no on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Now, after the free trade agreement of NAFTA destroyed jobs on both sides of the border, and then the Trans-Pacific Partnership is now the on steroids. And in the end, it is it it's going to create more poverty in in Mexico and and more of a border surge. I wonder, Bashar, again, I think passing this resolution is a grave mistake for one, as I mentioned earlier tonight. Your job is to protect US citizens allowing illegals to come in here and steal our jobs, dilute our quality of life. It's not protecting us. It is damaging us. Which you should be focused on the homeless, the unemployed, the veterans who are suffering, not people who come into this country as thieves and steal what's not theirs. I'm a veteran. My dad was better in two wars. I have a I have I have two sons. I've got a vested interest in my country. For you to come out and say that you're going to pass this resolution. When if you look back at the Immigration Act of 1986. We had all kinds of of guarantees. And what did it do? Nothing. It failed. In 1965, there was an immigration act. These programs will help to lift immigrant families out of poverty and also provide them with the relief of knowing that they no longer have to fear deportation. Furthermore, law enforcement leaders say that darkened DAPA would make our communities safer by taking immigration fears out of local interactions with police. The Major Cities Chief Police Association, which is a professional association of chiefs and sheriffs representing the largest cities in the U.S., the Police Executive Research Forum, and 27 law enforcement leaders in areas ranging from Iowa to Texas signed onto an amicus brief in support of these programs. In their brief, they state that deferred action promotes public safety by encouraging immigrants to come to court, to cooperate with law enforcement, and by providing a means to obtain secure and verifiable identification. So finally, I just want to say that we should reject the prejudice, intolerance and xenophobia that some speakers tonight are promoting. That would be moving us backwards at a time when we really need to heal from deep racial wounds. Instead, we should be moving forward towards policies of inclusion, justice and equity. Long Beach communities and economy shouldn't have to wait any longer. Thank you. So before before our next speaker just wanted to show so we have about probably another 40 to 45 minutes of public comment. And so I know I know I have one or two councilmembers that have to also have to be leaving. So I want to make sure that we try to get through. So I'm going to cut off the speaker's list at the very end. Who's the last person in line there, Senora? I'm closing the speaker's list. And I know that we have a lot of people that are that are obviously supporting the item. So if we can, as best as possible, expedite, you have your right to your 3 minutes. But please, I want to make sure that people are here for for the process. So please continue. And we have the speaker list is now closed. My name is Maria Barrientos. I have been living in Long Beach for 23 years and I wish. Laurie and I have lived in Long Beach for 23 years. And since I came to this country, I'll always pay my taxes. If you would support the immigration reform, it would be beneficial for me along with my daughter, since we've always dreamed of having our own beauty salon. And this would be a business that would also help the economy of Long Beach because we would support other people in growing, along with providing a source of work for others. If it's possible, I would like you all to support the immigration reform. Thank you very much for listening to me. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Thank you very much for your attention. My name is Ramon Gonzalez. I've been here for 20 years. Since October, some 57,000 unaccompanied minors, the vast majority from Central America, have crossed the illegal into the United States. Many conservatives are blaming the crisis on President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, also known as DOCA, which allows people brought here illegally as children. Conservatives say policy that the policy which newly arrived of newly arrived undocumented undocumented immigrants don't qualify for has acted as a magnet, pulling young migrants from violence plagued, poverty stricken countries like El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. But there's virtually no evidence to support this increasingly popular conservative talking point. Good evening, Honorable Major and Council. My name is Jonathan Solorzano. I am a community organizer with the Long Beach Immigrant Rights Coalition, as well as a lifelong resident of the city of Long Beach and a current resident of the ninth District. So I'm here today to show support for the DOC programs and also the need for comprehensive immigration reform. As you've already heard from our community residents, this is something the city really needs to get behind, because the truth is, our communities are disillusioned. They are disillusioned because undocumented immigrants deal with a variety of problems from housing, work prospects, wage theft, family separation and discrimination. We know our nation's immigration system is broken. And while we know it's difficult for local government to influence federal legislation, you have the power tonight to vote and show the nation what a city who embraces its immigrants looks like. Our community needs you to take a stand. Just as the mayors of two of the largest immigrant communities in the nation, Mayor Garcetti of Los Angeles and Mayor de Blasio of New York, as well as countless other other public figures have done so recently. And just to show you the support that is behind this resolution, I would actually like to ask those in the audience tonight to please stand. If you are in support of this. I would also like to take the fall to thank the following organizations for supporting this resolution, which are the Lumbee Human Rights Coalition, Greater Long Beach Interfaith Community Organization, Building Healthy Communities, Long Beach, CPC Lane. The Filipino Migrant Center, Central Maine. The Long Beach Coalition for Good Jobs in a Healthy Community Housing Long Beach Latinos in Action Clay then as well as 120 signatures collected from residents throughout this whole process. And we would also like to thank council members Lina Gonzalez, Suja Lowenthal, Roberta Ranga and Rex Richardson for sponsoring this resolution. And while we are thankful for those who are here, let's not forget the millions affected across the country and the thousands in our city and those deported in this current administration, including my own father. Thank you for your time, and we hope you'll vote in support of our community. Thank you. The Families United is the strongest that I know of, and we must protect the rights of all families to stay together. A family stays together, prays together. That is the only way you can live in a country like this. You have to give them a right to be together. You don't separate anyone from their family. I would totally support this issue. And the thing he brought to the diocese. Thank you very much, Lena, for doing this. Thank you. Next up next up is council member Richardson Jones. And I know I know everyone is supportive or not supportive, but if we could just try to get through the comments and please no side comments, I'd really appreciate it. I know it's difficult, but please. Councilor Richardson. And so with that, I'm happy to support this and thank you for bringing it forward. I got sick to my stomach earlier as well, so I'm going to be excusing myself after this vote. But I wanted to stay around to make sure that I. I voted yes on this. Thank you. Just I'll make a couple of brief comments and then we'll go and go to the vote. I'm maybe I'm I'm not sure this is part of the motion or not, Councilwoman, but I think it's probably appropriate that this, as being passed by the council tonight, would become officially also part of the federal agenda. Yes. And so I know is asking our government affairs director and some of the assumption is, Mr. City attorney, that this would then become part of that agenda, if that's part of the motion? That's correct. And then the second thing I'll say is I just want to echo something that was mentioned earlier, and I think it's really important. And one of the things that I love about this country is that we live in a democracy where people are able to have different opinions. And what what we should love about this great place that we live in is that whether we agree or disagree, we can do it in a way that's respectful and we can do it in a way that really lives up to the ideals of what this country was founded on. I there was a comment earlier about the Council focusing on on issues, on a variety of issues. And I just want to address those. And I'm proud of the fact that homeless homelessness is down in Long Beach by 18%. I'm proud of the fact that unemployment is at its lowest it's been in 15 years, that we have a great foster program in large part a lot of interest brought on to it because of Council Brough, Austin and others that and within the system that we have here. I'm proud that we have a goal to house every veteran in Long Beach that is experiencing homelessness by the end of this year. But I also think that supporting our our immigrants for supporting the men and women, but especially the children that are undocumented in our country in ways that I think we're very reasonable there. These are ways that these are regulations that I think our president has proposed that are reasonable, they're humane, they're thoughtful. They're not radical in any sort of way. I think they're very American regulations are very American policies. And so I want to thank everyone for for the conversation tonight. It's certainly been very, very vivid and very lively. But I want to thank Councilwoman Gonzales for for bringing this forward tonight. And so with that, we'll call the vote. Motion passes nine zero. So we're going to go back. Okay. So 1112, we're going to go on to item 13, I believe. Item 23. Item 23, if we can get the clerk to read in 23.",
