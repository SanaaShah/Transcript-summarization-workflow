Councilmember Pearce requested the city manager to report on the current enforcement process and to research how other cities are handling enforcement. The city manager explained that the health order requires masks to be worn almost at all times, with a few exceptions. Violations are treated as misdemeanors. Enforcement is primarily through reminders and handing out masks, but there are challenges when individuals refuse to comply. The council discussed the possibility of civilian enforcement and the need for clear communication about the rules. The city manager also emphasized that city employees are expected to adhere to the health order. The council agreed to further research and discussion on the matter."

Councilmember Peterson, back to you as chair of the committee to provide the committee report. Yes. As I've said before, we've been engaged in a very long intellectual conversation for 18 months or longer. Even right now. We had sunset at 930 just two months ago. Another one of the features as part of a pilot program is that the first ride must will only allow a user to travel at eight miles an hour. You know, one of my concerns was about equity. And especially within this eight mile an hour issue that was that was brought up, I asked asked if we could if when we saw users using these devices, that if they needed more learning time, could we make that change in the permit? And they said yes. In District six, Grandpa Bikes has had a, I believe, a very large back order during the pandemic because people are starting to move around their spaces and cities using this micro-mobility that is charged with electricity because it allows you to move as quickly as you need to without exerting effort that will make you sweaty when you appear at the destination that you're going to. I do appreciate that we need to be thinking about this in a robust manner with a delay. Councilmember, please. But nevertheless, in voting in favor of these two bills, I do want to make note that there is there are some important things I believe we need to continue to emphasize. I had been looking forward to a standard pilot project that would measure results for scooters, as we are seeing elsewhere in King County. As folks have said, this is a few years in the making. So thank you for all of your work on the issues to get to the heart of the questions that are being asked to us today and also for the Council President for sending that email to start so quickly and for Director Zimbabwe to answer those questions. As somebody who sees all the time as a pedestrian on a bike or the impact that myself and similarly situated bikers and pedestrians are put into by a society that relies on single occupancy vehicles for transportation. I continue to be concerned, as I'm concerned with lots of other transportation mode discussions, but it is definitely time that we tried this. Councilmember Lewis, are there any other comments on the bill? I really want to thank Councilmember Peterson again for his letter to Scott, because the concerns that we have need to be monitored. And that is only possible, in my mind, by moving from the theoretical and hypothetical to, to the real world. Yes. Yes.",

Councilmember Peterson, as chair of the committee, expressed concerns about safety, parking, equity, and the implementation of the program. Councilmember Strauss, the sponsor of the bills, argued that the program should be tried in the real world to gather data and address concerns. Councilmember Herbold expressed concerns about safety and sidewalk access, but was willing to vote in favor of the legislation. Councilmember Peterson, while supporting improved mobility options, had reservations about the legislation's lack of explicit safety measures and financial liability provisions. Councilmember Mosqueda expressed excitement about the legislation and its potential to provide more micro-mobility options. Councilmember Lewis also supported the legislation, citing the need for more transportation options. The bills were passed with nine votes in favor and none opposed."

    "reference_summary": "The meeting discussed the amendment and restatement of the service plan for the Denver International Business Center Metropolitan District. The purpose of the amendment is to make the service plan more consistent with those recently approved by the city, including adjusting the debt limitation to allow for continued development. The district supports a commercial-only development as residential construction is prohibited due to a zoning overlay currently imposed on the property by Denver International Airport. The district was organized in 1994 and the service plan was subsequently amended by the city in 2000. The district will finance and construct public improvements and operate and maintain the public improvements that are not accepted for ownership or maintenance by the city or any other entity. The district's public improvements will be for the use and benefit of the anticipated taxpayers of the district. The current and proposed commercial-only development will have a positive economic impact on the area, including employment and business cultivation. The district currently has approximately 205,000 square feet of commercial space, 31,000 square feet of retail space, and 980 hotel rooms with a combined appraised value of $90 million. It is estimated the continued development in the district will add 2.5 million square feet of commercial space, 130,000 square feet of retail space, 1700 hotel rooms and 900,000 square feet of light office space for an estimated future appraised value of $670 million. The total estimated costs of the future public improvements necessary to serve the continuing contemplated development is approximately $110,200,000. The district will have the power to raise revenues pursuant to the authorities granted by the Special District Act, including the imposition of up to 60 mills plus rates, fees, tolls and charges for debt and district operations and maintenance. The city staff recommends approval of the amended and restated service plan."

    "summary": "I'd first like to hear from the. Okay, so we have a motion on the floor in a second. All right, good. You. Let me before expressing my view on immigration specifically, let me say I was at the Council, the Board of Supervisors meeting last month, which was referenced by earlier speakers today. And any person that supports anything other than marching them back. The law should apply to everybody. I wonder, Bashar, again, I think passing this resolution is a grave mistake for one, as I mentioned earlier tonight. It's not protecting us. What did it do? You want to take it upon yourself to do something in this little town which the federal government has failed time after time to to to solve. And you want to make it even worse. Does The Invisible Man, Invisible Man, you believe in Jesus Christ does. Frankly, sir, we don't want to destroy that. I have been in this country for 26 years. When I was Barney Lowenthal at the Fourth District, I was helping there and I was helping the part of the Drake Park. That many others that they call themselves citizens. I have to fit in them. I would like to see them doing that kind of job. Good evening, Honorable Council members and staff. Bell, my name is goodbye. I have lived for ten years here in Long Beach. But our continuous support in order to continue to separate families in the negation of basic services is one party in mistrust, which are part of creating a sense of security in this country. But we must inform them that our work, they involve civic communities that involves community and city matters. Maya More yet my love for this city immigrant and my sense of civic duty may ask me to stand here today supporting the new generation of voters such as my grandchildren, my vecinos, my neighbors. 1/2, please. Hold on 1/2. We know that undocumented immigrants comprise nearly 10% of the state's workforce, contributing to a $130 billion annually to our state's gross domestic product. Good evening. Mothers and fathers and dreamers among them. I go to the deportation. Is mowing the lawn as a pandemic induced ban. When was I keep saying, you. Up, down. Thank you. Good evening. This money could be spent to improve infrastructure, education or other important local projects. So finally, I just want to say that we should reject the prejudice, intolerance and xenophobia that some speakers tonight are promoting. So before before our next speaker just wanted to show so we have about probably another 40 to 45 minutes of public comment. So I'm going to cut off the speaker's list at the very end. I'm closing the speaker's list. But please, I want to make sure that people are here for for the process. And since I came to this country, I'll always pay my taxes. And. I've been here for 20 years. Looking for an opportunity in order to achieve a dream. Why in this country. Because this country has. Participate or just is. And in this way, we can show. Thank you very much. Every illegal alien that comes here is in violation of America's sovereignty and our rule of law. They brought their corruption along across that border. And they do not love America. Why in the world would you want to take felons? I'm telling you, this will be the confrontation point of all immigration in the future. And he's actually now the current mayor of the city of Long Beach. There's currently a debate nationally about a flag that stood as a symbol of racism, that stood as a symbol of the ugliness. Again, I have my disagreement with the mayor over over the patriotism, because I'm a little bitter at the ugliness that we've seen in this country, because they're this country is based on a long history of telling people, no, you don't have the right to have the same resources I have. You don't have the right to create your own policy. Your God, I own a well, that Umana. The Filipino Migrant Center, Central Maine. The same thing. Expecting a different. Why would we do the same thing again? We'll get the same result. I'm not making that up. I would just like to echo what Janet said. Americans. The homelessness on the the civic property, I mean, it's jaw dropping. They're emotionally abused. They should be the focus of our society, our own suffering population. And in my opinion, as a city council, a body politic should make resolutions that, say, uphold respect and obey laws. This is why I would like to have your attention. Because by you passing this resolution, you are in violation of federal laws, because this is. They cross the border illegally. That's your number one responsibility. The courts eventually are going to put him in this place. Next speaker, please. It makes me suffer. Get Reformative in DA Gil Congress. Let's see. This will be much more eloquent in Spanish, but. Solution. Leave behind the deception. Laws that want to deport us. Yes. But I find that some of the comments, it literally makes my skin crawl to hear the the level of hatred, the level of racism in some in some cases that is being portrayed by some individuals. Than we cannot be, actually. So, sir, no more public comment. Immigrant families contribute to the U.S. economy in a variety of ways. They are our fathers, our mothers, our students. All of the positive things that we can we can mention in a dignified, well-planned path that includes taking the steps necessary to become a full fledged citizen is a must. I'm actually a councilmember, your rank who seconded the motion and then I'll go down the speakers less councilmember Orengo. Spanish. So it is that is important to yourself, I must say. I tried hard, but I told those barrelhouse Americanos. So what if you read it and there in Westeros that it was common was a mass. I am the son of immigrants and I had just as much right to be in this country as you do. And I'm going to die. You know, it's amazing to sit here and listen to the comments from the various people because the fact that being a minority myself as a black man and I'm hearing these comments about immigrants. I've watched those students. Who work harder than anyone I've seen there to let you know that a lot of their parents are immigrants and a lot of those immigrants a lot of those individuals are immigrants. We all have a right to live in America. You please. The Families United is the strongest that I know of, and we must protect the rights of all families to stay together. A family stays together, prays together. So I know that so the city council is well documented on this. And very easily, you can take out the word you can use those statements tonight and swap out the word illegal for the N-word very easily. It's a constant reminder that we have so much farther to go. But I'm comforted knowing that a great majority of us don't choose to rewrite that history. When you see people that whether they toil in their own countries or they toil in this country, certainly when I see them, I am reminded of my own parents who immigrated here. Because the moment we look away is the moment we think our work is done and our work is not done. We have that every week. But at the end of the day, we live among among one another in a community. And that is the bottom line. Thank you. But I just get too caught up in the moment that I had to say what I had to say. It's a city of great diversity that we celebrate. And we I'm serving on this dais with children of immigrants and with immigrants themselves. Thank you. Just I'll make a couple of brief comments and then we'll go and go to the vote. We can respectfully agree, but we have different opinions. And I just want to address those. Veteran veterans were brought up in homelessness and unemployment, all incredibly important issues that the city works on continuously. I'm proud that we have a goal to house every veteran in Long Beach that is experiencing homelessness by the end of this year. I think these are goals are probably a lot of everyone in this audience can agree that it's the right thing to do. So 1112, we're going to go on to item 13, I believe.",
